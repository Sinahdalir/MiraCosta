I get a solution less than 20 after 15 tries.
Yes it changes depending on the answer. With 1 & 2 I get less than 20 in about 15 tries
but answer 3 it takes a bout 30 tries or more.
This method doesn't have any benefits. The main bad thing is that some guesses are repeated and that wastes time.
 Also another bad thing about it is that it's not efficient.
